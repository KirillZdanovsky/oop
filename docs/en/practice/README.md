# Practice lessons

## Common information

Each practice lesson consists of two parts:

1. In the first part, the teacher gives you theoretical material and answers
your questions.

2. In the second part, you are supposed to accomplish tasks and submit them
to the teacher to check. Solo tasks are created with the expectation to cover
all aspects of the material covered.
