# Practice lessons

## Common information

Each practice lesson consists of two parts:

1. In the first part, the teacher gives you theoretical material and answers
your questions.

2. In the second part, you perform accomplish tasks and submit them to the 
teacher. Solo tasks are created with the expectation to cover all aspects of 
the material covered.
